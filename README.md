-  Hi, I’m @anup557
-  I’m interested in mostly codes in C, but other languages are also preferable
-  I’m currently learning some cryptographical tecniques, attacks on some ciphers. 
-  I’m looking to collaborate on this area

-  My mail id is "anupkundumath@gmail.com". 
-  If someone have some doubts with my code, they can mail me in this mailid. 
-  If someone think some other way will run the code faster than this, then please propose the idea, I will be really greatful to learn the new thing.
